 # Neuroscience!

Recently, I have been absolutely fascinated by the field of Neuroscience. I try to actively study different topics associated with the most complex organ, **the human brain**, that sits on top of our shoulders.    

The organ that houses the entire human consciousness and everything associated with it - fear, love, emotions, dreams, laughter etc. 

This repository is a collection of my notes on Neuroscience - an attempt to answer **_"Why we feel what we feel?"_** neuro-scientifically.

I use an application called **Notability** to write handwritten notes.
